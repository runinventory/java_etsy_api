This project is intended for those interested in calling the Etsy Api from Java.

The best way to start using it is to simply run the Example.java file that contains a main with an example of calling
2 Etsy Api methods. All the source files also contain a comments section that explains the purpose of the class. 
In total at the moment there are 5 files, one of which is the example. Currently only public method calls are 
supported.


To run the Example you will need to follow these steps:

1. Download the src/ directory, create a project for it in Eclipse or another environment that you are using

2. To make calls and to parse the JSON replies into Java objects, 2 external libraries are used: Jersey and GSON.

    You will need to reference 3 external Jars from your project:
       A. jersey-bundle-1.3.jar (Jersey)
       B. jsr311-api-1.1.jar (Jersey is implementation of this Java spec.)
       C. gson-1.6.jar (GSON)

   Top get Jersey go to:
       http://jersey.java.net/
       http://jsr311.java.net/

   To get GSON go to:
       http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/

3. In the file called EtsyApiParamsSimple.java modify the function called getEtsyApiKey() to return your Etsy Api Key

4. Run Example.java
