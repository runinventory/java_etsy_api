This project is for those interested in calling the Etsy Api from Java. Currently only public method calls are supported.

The best way to use it is simply run the Example.java file that contains a main with example of calling 2 methods. All the source files also
contain a comments section that explains the purpose of the class. In total at the moment there are 5 files, one of which is the example.


To run the Example you will need to follow these steps:

1. Download the src/ directory, create a project for it in Eclipse or another tool that you are using

2. To make calls to the Etsy web service and to parse the replies into Java objects, 2 external libraries are used: Jersey and GSON.

Top get Jersey go to:
http://jersey.java.net/

To get GSON go to:
http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/

Eventually you will need to reference 3 external Jars from your project:
   A. jersey-bundle-1.3.jar (Jersey)
   B. jsr311-api-1.1.jar (Jersey is implements this spec.)
   C. gson-1.6.jar (GSON)

3. In the file called EtsyApiParamsSimple.java modify the function called getEtsyApiKey() to return your Etsy Api Key

4. Run Example.java
